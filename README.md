# GANS

## Introduction
- The goal of this project is to create images of faces using generative adversarial networks.
- Gans was first developed by Ian Goodfellow in 2014.
- This is a combination of supervised and unsupervised algorithm.
- GANS contains two parts Generator and Discriminator.
- Noise is given as input to the generator passing through a series of convolutional layers to form images.
- Image celeba dataset form kaggle is taken as input for discriminator.
- The images generated by generator network are compared with the real images using sigmoid cross entropy function. If the probability of the image is closer to 1 that means the image is considered to be real or else it is fake image.

## Instructions
- Download the code from the repository.
- Run the file "python practice2.py".
